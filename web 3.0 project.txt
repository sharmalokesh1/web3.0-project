Write the differences between Web3.js and Ether.js. 2) Demonstrate how to read data from the Smart Contract with the
help of Web3.js.


Web3.js:

Web3.js is a JavaScript library that allows interaction with Ethereum nodes using the JSON-RPC protocol.
It is a general-purpose library for Ethereum development, providing a wide range of functionalities for working with smart contracts, transactions, accounts, and more.
Web3.js is not specific to any particular Ethereum-based blockchain and can be used with any Ethereum-compatible network.



Ether.js:

Ether.js is a more focused and lightweight library specifically designed for interacting with Ethereum blockchains.
It is built using TypeScript and provides a simplified and more intuitive API compared to Web3.js.
Ether.js is often considered more developer-friendly and provides a more modular structure for Ethereum-related operations.


Demonstrating how to read data from a Smart Contract using Web3.js:

Install Web3.js:

npm install web3


Create a JavaScript file

const Web3 = require('web3');

const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:8545');

const contractAddress = 'YourContractAddress';
const contractABI = [
    {
        "constant": true,
        "inputs": [],
        "name": "getData",
        "outputs": [{"name": "", "type": "uint256"}],
        "payable": false,
        "stateMutability": "view",
        "type": "function"
    }
];

const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);

contract.methods.getData().call()
    .then(result => {
        console.log('Data from Smart Contract:', result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error reading data from Smart Contract:', error);
    });


Run the Script:

node readContract.js
